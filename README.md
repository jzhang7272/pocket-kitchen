## Overview
### Description
This app presents you with a virtual kitchen - you can manage and keep track of the foods you have at home, whether it's in your fridge, freezer, or pantry. You'll be able to easily determine which foods are about to expire, check the quantity of food you currently have, and view nutritional facts of your food items. 

Other features (may) include:
- Providing recipe recommendations based on your current inventory
- Easy grocery list based on previously purchased goods
- Managing the food together with other people who are sharing the kitchen with you
- metrics based on expired foods (money wasted, quantity purchased(?))
